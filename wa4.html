			<h1 id="header">Game of Thrones</h1>
			<h2 id="subheader">An Anaylsis of Dialogue vs Gender</h2>
			<h3 id="refOne"> <a href="https://github.com/jeffreylancaster/game-of-thrones/tree/master/data">Here is the data I used for my analysis</a></h3>

<p class="paragraph">There has been much debate over how women were represented in the popular TV show, Game of Thrones. Many argued that the characters exemplified strong, unique roles, while others felt that there was something lacking in substance when it came to their representation. There was even a term that was coined from the show called, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-48335099">"sexposition"</a></html>in which viewers/critics felt that GoT abundantly used sex scenes to explain the plot and character motivations. Although I have personally never seen the show myself, I decided to use data to analyze the dialogue of Game of Thrones and see if it was more based around male verbal interactions vs female. </p>

<p class="paragraph">While analyzing the data, it did appear that there was a much larger amount of words spoken by male characters than female, just by glancing over it right off the bat. Despite there being many main characters that are female and having important, dialogue necessary roles within the show, males seemed to speak much more frequently than females. Due to the fact that this was so noticeable, I decided to make a graphic to properly visualize this difference </p>

<p class="paragraph">Looking at this graph, its apparent that there is a huge bias towards male characters when there is dialogue in each and every episode. In fact, according to <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/game-thrones-female-characters-25-percent-dialogue-entire-series-compared-1432647">this article,</a></html>only 25% of the dialogue goes to the female cast members throughout the entire SERIES, not even just the first 36 episodes. That discrepancy is huge comparatively, and especially in a show that has such a large female case with leading female roles, its almost puzzling how so many leading female characters can exist within the show and only end up speaking 25% of the time. </p>


<h4 class="bold">GoT Dialogue Statistics</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Percentage of time Females spoke in the first 36 episodes of GoT: 26.73%</li>
	<li>Percentage of time Males spoke in the first 36 episodes of GoT: 73.27%</li>
</ul>


<p class="paragraph">Based off of these assessments, it feels important to further explore the reason behind these large differences in numbers. With a little bit of research, it appears that many critics of the show seem to feel that many of the female characters are used physically to move the plot along vs with dialogue. This analysis goes back to the fruition of the term "sexposition" and how the show has many scenes with the male characters having sex with women, then the male characters having dialogue, and the women being used more as plot devices through said sex. Furthermore, audience members are arguing that when the female leads do accomplish their goals in the show, they end up "going mad" or being too emotional, a trope that many women are familiar with. They also point out that the show is written by a male, and argue that could be part of the issue as well. Especially in the final season, many critics viewed the female characters as losing their badassery in exchange for typical female descriptions. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/may/08/game-of-thrones-has-betrayed-the-women-who-made-it-great">An example of the many articles out there arguing this point.</a></html>  </p>

<p class="paragraph">Looking at the big picture of what this data represents, and what the feedback from the show represents as well, the argument that males speak more than females in GoT is 100% confirmed, and the argument that the show lost its sense of feminism could then be backed up by these findings. Due to all of this, looking at shows, and pop media in general, through a critical lense can help us realize how we are unconciously conditioned to expect certain things, whether that be gender roles or other big picture ideologies. Of course, it is impossible to excape bias in some form or the other, humans are inherently biased, and we live within or cultural norms. But we can always make strides to be more progressive. I think especially, as more females get opportunities to make media such as shows and moveis, we will get more and more broken tropes and refreshing viewpoints mainly due to the fact that a greater majority of shows and movies written since...well the beginning of shows and movies has been male. The same can be said about shows written and produced by other marginalized individuals as well. I think that is an exciting prospect as it means many different people will be able to more accuratley walk in the shoes of others through the easily accessible and empathy evoking forms of media that fill our world today.</p>
