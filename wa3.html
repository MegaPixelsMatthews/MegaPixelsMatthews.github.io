<p>The events of January 25th 2021 will definitely become something of historical significance, but the aftermath of the lashback from these events might determine just how significant these actions will truly end up being. In my personal opinion, I think the actions of the reddit users was not only commendable, but inspiring as well. Others may disagree, that such sort of market manipulation is unethical, but when the biggest perpetrators of these unethical practices are the ones crying wolf, it feels absurdly hypocritical. It truly is not a secret at this point that big companies, hedge funds, and the like use market manipulation among a vast array of other tactics in order to keep their firm grip on the stock market. </p>
<p>Since these events, law makers have become involved, which (as someone who is ambivalent of their government currently) may not end up being the best case scenario for the “people”. Concerning limiting online social platforms, I vehemently disagree that should be something that needs to be prioritized. I feel like nothing good can come from prohibition of free speech of any kind, not because I think all free speech is good (looking at the crazy trump supporters who thought they could organize a coup) but because I don’t think it actually solves the issue in banning it. Additionally, I think having platforms to organize in new and larger ways these days has lead to a lot of positive change as well. Particularly, I think that the rise in popularity of the “live stream” has helped important news spread globally in a way humans can view and empathize with like never before. Individuals were then able to turn inwards to their communities online and organize protests, fund important needs, educate others on topics, and share knowledge. I understand that this can be a double edged sword (again, looking at those crazy trump supporters and q-anon folks) but I feel like (hopefully) the pursuit of knowledge will persevere and we will get better at finding ways to share valuable, true information. I think when thinking collectively, especially in forums which are typically slower paced, more intentional, thoughtful planning can commence which more often than not can lead to positive change. </p>
<p>Researchers should be collecting data surrounding the “recipe” that caused this to happen, as well as other large collective actions coming together such as the George Floyd protests. I think looking at this data could help researchers to understand how information is being spread, where the information is coming from, and potentially even help to eradicate unhealthy organizations of individuals or thoughts by better understanding them. Additionally, researchers could explore the unhealthier aspects of collectivism online such as echo chambers or the rejection of important information for “alternative facts”. Personally, I think it’s important to be skeptical and explore just about everything that is being presented to you as FACTS in this day and age, but I think as a society we haven’t found the best way to properly get critical sources that are valuable to everyone without it presenting further problems. </p>
<p>As far as the platforms themselves go, I personally don’t see them as having much of an interest in being truly helpful in supporting their users in enacting positive change in their communities. Cynically, I don’t trust that any of these bigger platforms (Robinhood, Facebook/Instagram, Google, Twitter) have morals around helping the general public, and rather feel like they are some of the biggest cancers attached to our capitalistic society. But, if I were to put that aside, and tried to think more optimistically, I would say platforms should focus on a) not keeping users in a mindless scrolling brain suck of an echo chamber of content and b) helping to spread trustworthy and helpful facts to the general public. The second part I do see some sites beginning to focus on, at least a little bit which is good, but again, as a naturally skeptical person, it makes me curious to think what sources they deem as “irrefutable” and if there is anything sinister swaying their opinions on that as well. I do think that warning labels in general are always helpful, just because it gives everyone at least a second of pause and reflection.</p>
<p>If I were to explain this case to an 80 year old senator who has never heard of Reddit or short squeezes, I would first look at him banefully and wish that there was an age limitation on the senators we hold in our office, as well as quietly wish I wasn’t staring at yet another old white man who is somehow in charge of a very vast and not just white and old public. But, I would keep that all to myself. I would then explain Reddit in a nutshell as best that I could by saying it is a forum based platform where users can share content to specific little subcategories and have discussions underneath. I would also be sure to emphasize that Reddit is a HUGE umbrella of a website that truly holds a vast array of subcategories on all sides of each spectrum. I would then attempt to explain short squeezes as basically all of the hedge funds betting that Gamestop stocks would tank, manipulating the market to say so, but then circle back to the r/WallStreetBets subreddit and explain how all of the redditors essentially ruined all these extremely rich people’s bluffs by skyrocketing the value of Gamestop’s stocks. I would be sure to emphasize the fact that this market manipulation was something that those now hurt hedge fund and stock market bros do regularly and often and that the redditors were merely making a point of that. I am then sure that this 80 year old senator will instead demonize the redditors and will inevitably write legislation that makes it much more difficult for the individual, average wealth joe-schmo to replicate what those redditors did, but all of the rich hedge funds and the like will be able to carry on with their manipulations and profit with more money than any of them will ever be able to use in their life times. Maybe not though, maybe this is a really awesome 80 year old senator and he will surprise us all and help to write legislation that will keep the huge corporations and excessively rich in check and give some of us “poors” a fighting chance to make money beyond the hardly livable wage and $600 stimulus checks. </p>
